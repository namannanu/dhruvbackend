## 1. TeamAccess Model

### File: `src/modules/team/teamAccess.model.js`

The TeamAccess model is the core of the delegation system, allowing users to grant access to their businesses to other users.

#### Key Features:
- **Access Levels**: `full_access`, `manage_operations`, `view_only`
- **Access Scopes**: 
  - `user_specific`: Access to specific user's resources
  - `business_specific`: Access to specific business only
  - `all_owner_businesses`: Access to all businesses owned by the managed user
  - `independent_operator`: Can create and manage own businesses
- **Granular Permissions**: 47+ specific permissions for different operations
- **Business Context**: Controls which businesses the user can access
- **Validation**: Time-based restrictions, expiration dates, status management

#### Permission Categories:
```javascript
// Business Management
canCreateBusiness, canEditBusiness, canDeleteBusiness, canViewBusiness

// Job Management
canCreateJobs, canEditJobs, canDeleteJobs, canViewJobs

// Worker Management
canViewWorkers, canManageWorkers, canHireWorkers, canFireWorkers

// Application Management
canViewApplications, canManageApplications

// Shift & Schedule Management
canCreateShifts, canEditShifts, canDeleteShifts, canViewShifts

// Attendance Management
canCreateAttendance, canEditAttendance, canViewAttendance, canManageAttendance

// Team Management
canViewTeam, canManageTeam, canGrantAccess

// Financial Management
canViewPayments, canManagePayments, canProcessPayments
canViewBudgets, canManageBudgets

// Analytics & Reporting
canViewAnalytics, canViewReports, canExportData

// Employment Management
canViewEmployment, canManageEmployment
```

#### Key Methods:
- `isAccessValid`: Validates if access is currently valid
- `getEffectivePermissions()`: Combines access level defaults with custom permissions
- `hasPermission(key)`: Checks if user has specific permission
- `matchesTargetUser(id)`: Validates if access applies to target user
- `checkAccess()`: Static method for comprehensive access validation

## 2. Permission System Integration

### File: `src/shared/middlewares/permissionMiddleware.js`

Enhanced the existing permission middleware to support TeamAccess integration.

#### Major Changes:

##### A. TeamAccess Permission Resolution
```javascript
async function getUserPermissions(userId, businessId) {
  // 1. Check TeamAccess records first
  const user = await User.findById(userId);
  const teamAccess = await TeamAccess.findOne({
    userEmail: user.email.toLowerCase(),
    status: 'active'
  });
  
  if (teamAccess && teamAccess.isAccessValid) {
    // Apply business context validation
    // Map TeamAccess permissions to system permissions
    // Return resolved permissions array
  }
  
  // 2. Fall back to business ownership
  // 3. Fall back to legacy team membership
}
```

##### B. Permission Mapping System
Added comprehensive mapping from TeamAccess camelCase permissions to system snake_case permissions:

```javascript
// Example mappings
if (teamAccess.permissions.canCreateJobs) permissions.push('create_jobs');
if (teamAccess.permissions.canHireWorkers) permissions.push('hire_workers');
if (teamAccess.permissions.canViewJobs) permissions.push('view_jobs');

// Dual mappings for schedules
if (teamAccess.permissions.canCreateAttendance) permissions.push('create_schedules');
if (teamAccess.permissions.canCreateShifts) permissions.push('create_schedules');
```

##### C. Business Context Validation
```javascript
// Access scope validation
if (teamAccess.accessScope === 'independent_operator') {
  // Can manage own businesses + businesses with allBusinesses access
}
else if (teamAccess.accessScope === 'business_specific') {
  // Limited to specific business ID
}
else if (teamAccess.accessScope === 'all_owner_businesses') {
  // Access to all businesses owned by original user
}
```

---

## 3. Business Access Utilities

### File: `src/shared/utils/businessAccess.js`

Created comprehensive business access validation system supporting both legacy team membership and new TeamAccess system.

#### Key Functions:

##### A. `ensureBusinessAccess()`
```javascript
async function ensureBusinessAccess({
  user,
  businessId,
  requiredPermissions,
  requireActiveTeamMember = true
}) {
  // 1. Validate business exists
  // 2. Check if user is business owner (full access)
  // 3. Check legacy team membership
  // 4. Check TeamAccess records with MongoDB aggregation
  // 5. Validate permissions against requirements
  // 6. Return access context
}
```

##### B. TeamAccess Query Structure
```javascript
const teamAccess = await TeamAccess.findOne({
  $and: [
    {
      $or: [
        { employeeId: userId },
        { userEmail: user.email }
      ]
    },
    {
      status: { $in: ['active', 'pending'] }
    },
    {
      $or: [
        { 'businessContext.businessId': business._id },
        { 'businessContext.allBusinesses': true },
        { accessScope: 'all_owner_businesses' }
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```

##### C. Permission Validation Switch
```javascript
switch (permission) {
  case 'create_jobs': hasPermission = permissions.canCreateJobs; break;
  case 'hire_workers': hasPermission = permissions.canHireWorkers; break;
  case 'view_jobs': hasPermission = permissions.canViewJobs; break;
  case 'create_schedules': 
    hasPermission = permissions.canCreateAttendance || permissions.canCreateShifts; 
    break;
  // ... 47+ permission mappings
}
```

##### D. `getAccessibleBusinessIds()`
```javascript
async function getAccessibleBusinessIds(user) {
  // 1. Get owned businesses
  // 2. Get legacy team memberships
  // 3. Get TeamAccess businesses
  // 4. Handle allBusinesses access
  // 5. Return Set of accessible business IDs
}
```

## 4. Route Protection & Middleware

### Updated Route Files:

#### A. Job Routes (`src/modules/jobs/job.routes.js`)
```javascript
// Added worker-friendly permission middleware
const ensureViewJobDetailsPermission = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user?.userType === 'worker') {
    return next(); // Workers can view job details without permission checks
  }
  return requirePermissions('view_jobs')(req, res, next);
};

// Applied to routes
router.get('/:jobId', protect, ensureViewJobDetailsPermission, controller.getJob);
router.post('/', protect, requirePermissions('create_jobs'), controller.createJob);
router.post('/applications/:applicationId/hire', protect, requirePermissions('hire_workers'), controller.hireApplicant);
```

#### B. Permission Middleware Enhancements
```javascript
function requirePermissions(permissions, options = {}) {
  return async (req, res, next) => {
    // 1. Extract business ID from request context
    const businessId = await getBusinessIdFromRequest(req);
    
    // 2. Get user permissions (including TeamAccess)
    const userPermissions = await getUserPermissions(req.user.id, businessId);
    
    // 3. Validate permissions
    const hasAccess = hasPermission(userPermissions, permissions);
    
    // 4. Allow/deny access
    if (!hasAccess) {
      return next(new AppError(`Insufficient permissions. Required: ${permissions}`, 403));
    }
    
    req.userPermissions = userPermissions;
    req.businessId = businessId;
    next();
  };
}
```

## 5. Job Management Integration

### File: `src/modules/jobs/job.controller.js`

#### A. Job Creation with Business Access
```javascript
exports.createJob = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
  // Extract business ID from request
  const businessId = req.body.business || req.body.businessId;
  
  // Use enhanced business access validation
  const { business } = await ensureBusinessAccess({
    user: req.user,
    businessId,
    requiredPermissions: 'create_jobs',
  });
  
  // Create job with validated business context
});
```

#### B. Hiring with TeamAccess Support
```javascript
exports.hireApplicant = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
  // Get job and validate business access
  const application = await Application.findById(applicationId).populate('job');
  
  // Use business access validation instead of direct ownership
  await ensureBusinessAccess({
    user: req.user,
    businessId: application.job.business,
    requiredPermissions: 'hire_workers',
  });
  
  // Process hiring with proper permission validation
});
```

## 7. Business ID Extraction

### File: `src/shared/middlewares/permissionMiddleware.js`

#### Function: `getBusinessIdFromRequest()`

Enhanced business ID extraction to support various request contexts:

```javascript
async function getBusinessIdFromRequest(req) {
  // 1. JWT token payload (for team members with business context)
  if (req.tokenPayload?.businessId) return req.tokenPayload.businessId;
  
  // 2. URL parameters
  if (req.params.businessId) return req.params.businessId;
  
  // 3. Employer ID to business mapping
  if (req.params.employerId) {
    const business = await Business.findOne({ owner: req.params.employerId });
    return business?._id.toString();
  }
  
  // 4. Job ID to business mapping
  if (req.params.jobId) {
    const job = await Job.findById(req.params.jobId).select('business');
    return job?.business?.toString();
  }
  
  // 5. Application ID to business mapping
  if (req.params.applicationId) {
    const application = await Application.findById(req.params.applicationId)
      .populate('job', 'business');
    return application?.job?.business?.toString();
  }
  
  // 6. Request body/query parameters
  if (req.body.businessId) return req.body.businessId;
  if (req.query.businessId) return req.query.businessId;
  
  // 7. Headers
  if (req.headers['x-business-id']) return req.headers['x-business-id'];
  
  // 8. Employer's primary business
  if (req.user?.userType === 'employer') {
    const business = await Business.findOne({ owner: req.user.id });
    return business?._id.toString();
  }
  
  return null;
}
```

#### Business ID Context Mapping

| Request Context | Business ID Source | Example |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Direct business operations | `req.params.businessId` | `/businesses/:businessId` |
| Job operations | Job document business field | `/jobs/:jobId` → Job.business |
| Application operations | Application → Job → Business | `/applications/:applicationId` |
| Employer operations | User's owned business | User.id → Business.owner |
| Headers | `x-business-id` header | Custom business context |
| Body/Query | Request payload | `{ businessId: "..." }` |

## 8. Testing & Validation

### Debug Scripts Created

#### A. Permission Testing (`test-permission.js`)
```javascript
// Tests permission resolution for specific user/business/job combinations
// Validates TeamAccess permission mapping
// Simulates middleware permission checking
```

#### B. User Access Validation (`check-user-access.js`)
```javascript
// Validates user exists and has correct email
// Lists all TeamAccess records for debugging
// Shows permission states and business contexts
```

#### C. Job Validation (`check-job.js`)
```javascript
// Validates job existence and business relationships
// Tests business ID extraction from job IDs
// Debugs job-to-business mappings
```

### Test Cases Validated

1. **TeamAccess Permission Resolution**
   - ✅ User with `canViewJobs: true` can access job details
   - ✅ User with `canCreateJobs: true` can create jobs
   - ✅ User with `canHireWorkers: true` can hire workers
   - ✅ User with `canCreateAttendance: true` can create schedules

2. **Business Context Validation**
   - ✅ `allBusinesses: true` grants access to all managed user's businesses
   - ✅ `business_specific` limits access to specific business
   - ✅ Business ownership validation works correctly

3. **Permission Mapping**
   - ✅ CamelCase TeamAccess permissions map to snake_case system permissions
   - ✅ Dual mappings work (attendance permissions → schedule permissions)
   - ✅ Multiple permission sources combine correctly

4. **Route Protection**
   - ✅ Workers can view job details without permissions
   - ✅ Employers need proper permissions for business operations
   - ✅ TeamAccess users get appropriate access levels
